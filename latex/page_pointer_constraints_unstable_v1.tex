protocol for constraining pointer motions\hypertarget{page_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1_page_desc_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1}{}\doxysection{Description}\label{page_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1_page_desc_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1}
This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used for adding constraints to the motion of a pointer. Possible constraints include confining pointer motions to a given region, or locking it to its current position.

In order to constrain the pointer, a client must first bind the global interface \char`\"{}wp\+\_\+pointer\+\_\+constraints\char`\"{} which, if a compositor supports pointer constraints, is exposed by the registry. Using the bound global object, the client uses the request that corresponds to the type of constraint it wants to make. See wp\+\_\+pointer\+\_\+constraints for more details.

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the \textquotesingle{}z\textquotesingle{} prefix and the version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is reset.\hypertarget{page_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1_page_ifaces_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1}{}\doxysection{Interfaces}\label{page_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1_page_ifaces_pointer_constraints_unstable_v1}

The global interface exposing pointer constraining functionality. It exposes two requests\+: lock\+\_\+pointer for locking the pointer to its position, and confine\+\_\+pointer for locking the pointer to a region.

The lock\+\_\+pointer and confine\+\_\+pointer requests create the objects wp\+\_\+locked\+\_\+pointer and wp\+\_\+confined\+\_\+pointer respectively, and the client can use these objects to interact with the lock.

For any surface, only one lock or confinement may be active across all wl\+\_\+pointer objects of the same seat. If a lock or confinement is requested when another lock or confinement is active or requested on the same surface and with any of the wl\+\_\+pointer objects of the same seat, an \textquotesingle{}already\+\_\+constrained\textquotesingle{} error will be raised. \hypertarget{page_iface_zwp_pointer_constraints_v1_page_iface_zwp_pointer_constraints_v1_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zwp_pointer_constraints_v1_page_iface_zwp_pointer_constraints_v1_api}

The wp\+\_\+locked\+\_\+pointer interface represents a locked pointer state.

While the lock of this object is active, the wl\+\_\+pointer objects of the associated seat will not emit any wl\+\_\+pointer.\+motion events.

This object will send the event \textquotesingle{}locked\textquotesingle{} when the lock is activated. Whenever the lock is activated, it is guaranteed that the locked surface will already have received pointer focus and that the pointer will be within the region passed to the request creating this object.

To unlock the pointer, send the destroy request. This will also destroy the wp\+\_\+locked\+\_\+pointer object.

If the compositor decides to unlock the pointer the unlocked event is sent. See wp\+\_\+locked\+\_\+pointer.\+unlock for details.

When unlocking, the compositor may warp the cursor position to the set cursor position hint. If it does, it will not result in any relative motion events emitted via wp\+\_\+relative\+\_\+pointer.

If the surface the lock was requested on is destroyed and the lock is not yet activated, the wp\+\_\+locked\+\_\+pointer object is now defunct and must be destroyed. \hypertarget{page_iface_zwp_locked_pointer_v1_page_iface_zwp_locked_pointer_v1_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zwp_locked_pointer_v1_page_iface_zwp_locked_pointer_v1_api}

The wp\+\_\+confined\+\_\+pointer interface represents a confined pointer state.

This object will send the event \textquotesingle{}confined\textquotesingle{} when the confinement is activated. Whenever the confinement is activated, it is guaranteed that the surface the pointer is confined to will already have received pointer focus and that the pointer will be within the region passed to the request creating this object. It is up to the compositor to decide whether this requires some user interaction and if the pointer will warp to within the passed region if outside.

To unconfine the pointer, send the destroy request. This will also destroy the wp\+\_\+confined\+\_\+pointer object.

If the compositor decides to unconfine the pointer the unconfined event is sent. The wp\+\_\+confined\+\_\+pointer object is at this point defunct and should be destroyed. \hypertarget{page_iface_zwp_confined_pointer_v1_page_iface_zwp_confined_pointer_v1_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zwp_confined_pointer_v1_page_iface_zwp_confined_pointer_v1_api}
