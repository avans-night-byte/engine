\hypertarget{page_iface_wl_registry_page_iface_wl_registry_desc}{}\doxysubsection{Description}\label{page_iface_wl_registry_page_iface_wl_registry_desc}
The singleton global registry object. The server has a number of global objects that are available to all clients. These objects typically represent an actual object in the server (for example, an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide extension functionality.

When a client creates a registry object, the registry object will emit a global event for each global currently in the registry. Globals come and go as a result of device or monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the registry will send out global and global\+\_\+remove events to keep the client up to date with the changes. To mark the end of the initial burst of events, the client can use the wl\+\_\+display.\+sync request immediately after calling wl\+\_\+display.\+get\+\_\+registry.

A client can bind to a global object by using the bind request. This creates a client-\/side handle that lets the object emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on the object. \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_registry_page_iface_wl_registry_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_registry_page_iface_wl_registry_api}

The wl\+\_\+shm\+\_\+pool object encapsulates a piece of memory shared between the compositor and client. Through the wl\+\_\+shm\+\_\+pool object, the client can allocate shared memory wl\+\_\+buffer objects. All objects created through the same pool share the same underlying mapped memory. Reusing the mapped memory avoids the setup/teardown overhead and is useful when interactively resizing a surface or for many small buffers. \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_shm_pool_page_iface_wl_shm_pool_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_shm_pool_page_iface_wl_shm_pool_api}

The wl\+\_\+data\+\_\+device\+\_\+manager is a singleton global object that provides access to inter-\/client data transfer mechanisms such as copy-\/and-\/paste and drag-\/and-\/drop. These mechanisms are tied to a wl\+\_\+seat and this interface lets a client get a wl\+\_\+data\+\_\+device corresponding to a wl\+\_\+seat.

It provides requests to treat surfaces like toplevel, fullscreen or popup windows, move, resize or maximize them, associate metadata like title and class, etc.

On the server side the object is automatically destroyed when the related wl\+\_\+surface is destroyed. On the client side, wl\+\_\+shell\+\_\+surface\+\_\+destroy() must be called before destroying the wl\+\_\+surface object. \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_shell_surface_page_iface_wl_shell_surface_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_shell_surface_page_iface_wl_shell_surface_api}

\hypertarget{page_iface_wl_surface_page_iface_wl_surface_desc}{}\doxysubsection{Description}\label{page_iface_wl_surface_page_iface_wl_surface_desc}
A surface is a rectangular area that is displayed on the screen. It has a location, size and pixel contents.

The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described in surface-\/local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer\+\_\+transform or a buffer\+\_\+scale is used.

A surface without a \char`\"{}role\char`\"{} is fairly useless\+: a compositor does not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the purpose of a wl\+\_\+surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a pointer (as set by wl\+\_\+pointer.\+set\+\_\+cursor), a drag icon (wl\+\_\+data\+\_\+device.\+start\+\_\+drag), a sub-\/surface (wl\+\_\+subcompositor.\+get\+\_\+subsurface), and a window as defined by a shell protocol (e.\+g. wl\+\_\+shell.\+get\+\_\+shell\+\_\+surface).

A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a wl\+\_\+surface does not have a role. Once a wl\+\_\+surface is given a role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the wl\+\_\+surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed, unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface specification.

Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as wl\+\_\+pointer.\+set\+\_\+cursor. The request should explicitly mention that this request gives a role to a wl\+\_\+surface. Often, this request also creates a new protocol object that represents the role and adds additional functionality to wl\+\_\+surface. When a client wants to destroy a wl\+\_\+surface, they must destroy this \textquotesingle{}role object\textquotesingle{} before the wl\+\_\+surface.

Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the wl\+\_\+surface, but it may stop the wl\+\_\+surface from \char`\"{}playing the role\char`\"{}. For instance, if a wl\+\_\+subsurface object is destroyed, the wl\+\_\+surface it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and z-\/order. It is allowed to create a wl\+\_\+subsurface for the same wl\+\_\+surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl\+\_\+surface as a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-\/surface, and role switching is not allowed). \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_surface_page_iface_wl_surface_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_surface_page_iface_wl_surface_api}

The global interface exposing sub-\/surface compositing capabilities. A wl\+\_\+surface, that has sub-\/surfaces associated, is called the parent surface. Sub-\/surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create a tree of sub-\/surfaces.

The root surface in a tree of sub-\/surfaces is the main surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-\/surface, because sub-\/surfaces must always have a parent.

A main surface with its sub-\/surfaces forms a (compound) window. For window management purposes, this set of wl\+\_\+surface objects is to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as such.

The aim of sub-\/surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is a video player with decorations and video in separate wl\+\_\+surface objects. This should allow the compositor to pass Y\+UV video buffer processing to dedicated overlay hardware when possible. \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_subcompositor_page_iface_wl_subcompositor_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_subcompositor_page_iface_wl_subcompositor_api}

\hypertarget{page_iface_wl_subsurface_page_iface_wl_subsurface_desc}{}\doxysubsection{Description}\label{page_iface_wl_subsurface_page_iface_wl_subsurface_desc}
An additional interface to a wl\+\_\+surface object, which has been made a sub-\/surface. A sub-\/surface has one parent surface. A sub-\/surface\textquotesingle{}s size and position are not limited to that of the parent. Particularly, a sub-\/surface is not automatically clipped to its parent\textquotesingle{}s area.

A sub-\/surface becomes mapped, when a non-\/\+N\+U\+LL wl\+\_\+buffer is applied and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens first is irrelevant. A sub-\/surface is hidden if the parent becomes hidden, or if a N\+U\+LL wl\+\_\+buffer is applied. These rules apply recursively through the tree of surfaces.

The behaviour of a wl\+\_\+surface.\+commit request on a sub-\/surface depends on the sub-\/surface\textquotesingle{}s mode. The possible modes are synchronized and desynchronized, see methods wl\+\_\+subsurface.\+set\+\_\+sync and wl\+\_\+subsurface.\+set\+\_\+desync. Synchronized mode caches the wl\+\_\+surface state to be applied when the parent\textquotesingle{}s state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending wl\+\_\+surface state directly. A sub-\/surface is initially in the synchronized mode.

Sub-\/surfaces have also other kind of state, which is managed by wl\+\_\+subsurface requests, as opposed to wl\+\_\+surface requests. This state includes the sub-\/surface position relative to the parent surface (wl\+\_\+subsurface.\+set\+\_\+position), and the stacking order of the parent and its sub-\/surfaces (wl\+\_\+subsurface.\+place\+\_\+above and .place\+\_\+below). This state is applied when the parent surface\textquotesingle{}s wl\+\_\+surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-\/surface\textquotesingle{}s mode. As the exception, set\+\_\+sync and set\+\_\+desync are effective immediately.

The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode, since it does not have a parent in the sub-\/surfaces sense.

Even if a sub-\/surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-\/surface into synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-\/child sub-\/surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.

If the wl\+\_\+surface associated with the wl\+\_\+subsurface is destroyed, the wl\+\_\+subsurface object becomes inert. Note, that destroying either object takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal of a sub-\/surface to the parent surface update, unmap the sub-\/surface first by attaching a N\+U\+LL wl\+\_\+buffer, update parent, and then destroy the sub-\/surface.

If the parent wl\+\_\+surface object is destroyed, the sub-\/surface is unmapped. \hypertarget{page_iface_wl_subsurface_page_iface_wl_subsurface_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_wl_subsurface_page_iface_wl_subsurface_api}
