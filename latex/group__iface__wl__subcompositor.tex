\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The global interface exposing sub-\/surface compositing capabilities. A wl\+\_\+surface, that has sub-\/surfaces associated, is called the parent surface. Sub-\/surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create a tree of sub-\/surfaces.

The root surface in a tree of sub-\/surfaces is the main surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-\/surface, because sub-\/surfaces must always have a parent.

A main surface with its sub-\/surfaces forms a (compound) window. For window management purposes, this set of wl\+\_\+surface objects is to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as such.

The aim of sub-\/surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is a video player with decorations and video in separate wl\+\_\+surface objects. This should allow the compositor to pass Y\+UV video buffer processing to dedicated overlay hardware when possible.
