seat capabilities changed

This is emitted whenever a seat gains or loses the pointer, keyboard or touch capabilities. The argument is a capability enum containing the complete set of capabilities this seat has.

When the pointer capability is added, a client may create a wl\+\_\+pointer object using the wl\+\_\+seat.\+get\+\_\+pointer request. This object will receive pointer events until the capability is removed in the future.

When the pointer capability is removed, a client should destroy the wl\+\_\+pointer objects associated with the seat where the capability was removed, using the wl\+\_\+pointer.\+release request. No further pointer events will be received on these objects.

In some compositors, if a seat regains the pointer capability and a client has a previously obtained wl\+\_\+pointer object of version 4 or less, that object may start sending pointer events again. This behavior is considered a misinterpretation of the intended behavior and must not be relied upon by the client. wl\+\_\+pointer objects of version 5 or later must not send events if created before the most recent event notifying the client of an added pointer capability.

The above behavior also applies to wl\+\_\+keyboard and wl\+\_\+touch with the keyboard and touch capabilities, respectively.

unique identifier for this seat

In a multiseat configuration this can be used by the client to help identify which physical devices the seat represents. Based on the seat configuration used by the compositor.
