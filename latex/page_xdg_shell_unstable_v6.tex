xdg\+\_\+shell allows clients to turn a wl\+\_\+surface into a \char`\"{}real window\char`\"{} which can be dragged, resized, stacked, and moved around by the user. Everything about this interface is suited towards traditional desktop environments. \hypertarget{page_iface_zxdg_shell_v6_page_iface_zxdg_shell_v6_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zxdg_shell_v6_page_iface_zxdg_shell_v6_api}

The xdg\+\_\+positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure the child surface remains within the visible area\textquotesingle{}s borders, and to specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-\/created rules are constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

See the various requests for details about possible rules.

At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules specified by the xdg\+\_\+positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the xdg\+\_\+positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the object will have no effect on previous usages.

For an xdg\+\_\+positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a non-\/zero size set by set\+\_\+size, and a non-\/zero anchor rectangle set by set\+\_\+anchor\+\_\+rect. Passing an incomplete xdg\+\_\+positioner object when positioning a surface raises an error. \hypertarget{page_iface_zxdg_positioner_v6_page_iface_zxdg_positioner_v6_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zxdg_positioner_v6_page_iface_zxdg_positioner_v6_api}

An interface that may be implemented by a wl\+\_\+surface, for implementations that provide a desktop-\/style user interface.

It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into xdg\+\_\+surface roles.

Creating an xdg\+\_\+surface does not set the role for a wl\+\_\+surface. In order to map an xdg\+\_\+surface, the client must create a role-\/specific object using, e.\+g., get\+\_\+toplevel, get\+\_\+popup. The wl\+\_\+surface for any given xdg\+\_\+surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role not based on xdg\+\_\+surface.

A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the xdg\+\_\+surface object.

The client must call wl\+\_\+surface.\+commit on the corresponding wl\+\_\+surface for the xdg\+\_\+surface state to take effect.

Creating an xdg\+\_\+surface from a wl\+\_\+surface which has a buffer attached or committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg\+\_\+surface.\+configure call must also be treated as errors.

For a surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following conditions must be met\+: (1) the client has assigned a xdg\+\_\+surface based role to the surface, (2) the client has set and committed the xdg\+\_\+surface state and the role dependent state to the surface and (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface. \hypertarget{page_iface_zxdg_surface_v6_page_iface_zxdg_surface_v6_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zxdg_surface_v6_page_iface_zxdg_surface_v6_api}

This interface defines an xdg\+\_\+surface role which allows a surface to, among other things, set window-\/like properties such as maximize, fullscreen, and minimize, set application-\/specific metadata like title and id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive resize and move. \hypertarget{page_iface_zxdg_toplevel_v6_page_iface_zxdg_toplevel_v6_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zxdg_toplevel_v6_page_iface_zxdg_toplevel_v6_api}

A popup surface is a short-\/lived, temporary surface. It can be used to implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user interface concepts.

A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg\+\_\+popup.\+grab for details.

When the popup is dismissed, a popup\+\_\+done event will be sent out, and at the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg\+\_\+popup.\+popup\+\_\+done event for details.

Explicitly destroying the xdg\+\_\+popup object will also dismiss the popup and unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy request.

The parent surface must have either the xdg\+\_\+toplevel or xdg\+\_\+popup surface role.

A newly created xdg\+\_\+popup will be stacked on top of all previously created xdg\+\_\+popup surfaces associated with the same xdg\+\_\+toplevel.

The parent of an xdg\+\_\+popup must be mapped (see the xdg\+\_\+surface description) before the xdg\+\_\+popup itself.

The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See xdg\+\_\+surface.\+get\+\_\+popup. An xdg\+\_\+popup must intersect with or be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

The client must call wl\+\_\+surface.\+commit on the corresponding wl\+\_\+surface for the xdg\+\_\+popup state to take effect. \hypertarget{page_iface_zxdg_popup_v6_page_iface_zxdg_popup_v6_api}{}\doxysubsection{A\+PI}\label{page_iface_zxdg_popup_v6_page_iface_zxdg_popup_v6_api}
